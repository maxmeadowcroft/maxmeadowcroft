# Hi, I'm Maximus!

Hello, I am finishing up college at New Mexico Tech, expected to graduate in May 2025 with a Bachelors degree in CS. I mostly program Python, but I am proficient in C, C++, HTML, CSS, React, JS, and more. I help people learn Python and progress in it. I make content on social media, have a newsletter, and run a [Python based community](skool.com/coder). If you want to see more about me or some things I am currently up to, here is the [website for the community](www.pythonscale.com), here is my [personal website](www.maxmeadowcroft.com), and here is my [Stan Store](https://stan.store/maximusmeadowcroft) where I have some products (free and paid) as well as resources. 

# What I am currently working on

Currently I am working on building out my portfolio and creating resources and products to help people learn and excell at Python. My main focuses are in growing my newsletter (linked below), adding more value to my content (linked below), and creating cool projects (next section). I am also finishing up college in parallel with this.
